## Routing for logins

- [ ] Add a route for "Login"
- Create a "login" folder
- Create a LoginManager component (the basic template will do for now) under the `login` folder
- In `NavBarWithLayout.tsx`, add a `NavLink` for `/login`
- In `App.tsx` add a `Route` (under the one for the root) for 'login' that loads `LoginManager`
- Try it out!
